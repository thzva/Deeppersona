His diet consists of simple, hearty meals with lean proteins and rare fruit consumption, complemented by refined whiskey tasting.\n\nProfessionally, he is employed full-time as a Guest Relations Officer in the hospitality and guest services industry, holding a mid-level management position with leadership responsibilities. His work environment is structured, controlled, and moderately isolated, with a preference for limited collaboration and independent work. He has extensive experience in project control, team oversight, risk management, and guest experience management, but no formal Scrum Master certification.

He is certified in hospitality management software systems and focuses on local and regional operations within the Canadian hospitality sector.\n\nHis personal philosophy emphasizes pragmatic decision-making, cautious trust, and self-preservation, with an authoritative yet cautious parenting style that stresses clear boundaries and consistency. He values fairness without idealism, personal autonomy, and maintains a low risk tolerance in financial matters, favoring secure investments. Socially, he prefers small, trusted circles, communicates directly and tersely, and avoids substances and social dining events. Culturally, he shows interest in classic dystopian science fiction, underground music, and independent films, favoring minimalist, functional attire with dark tones. His leisure activities include occasional indoor herb gardening, reflective journal writing on hiking experiences, and minimal engagement in gaming or community activities."
